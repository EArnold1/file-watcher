# File Watcher

A simple tool written in Rust that monitors files and directories for changes. When a modification is detected, it prints a notification to the console.

## Features

- **Recursive Monitoring:** Monitors an entire directory tree, watching all nested files and folders.
- **File & Folder Support:** Supports both individual files and directories as input targets.
- **Real-time Notifications:** Detects and reports file system events like modifications, deletions, and renames immediately via terminal output.
