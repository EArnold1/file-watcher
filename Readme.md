# File Watcher

A simple tool written in Rust that monitors a single file for changes. When a modification is detected, it prints a notification to the console.

## Features

- **Single File Monitoring:** This version is designed to watch only one specified file.
- **Real-time Notifications:** Upon detecting any change (modification, deletion, or renaming) to the target file, a message indicating the event is printed to the terminal.
